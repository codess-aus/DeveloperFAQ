        <div class="post-body">
            <p>GitHub Copilot's #CodingAgent is at the core of how I kick off new personal projects(obviously I use a slightly different approach for Enterprise Projects), especially when I start with documentation. Almost every time, I begin by spinning up a new repository on GitHub.com, and the first thing I do is set up MkDocs. Copilot's Agent takes my plain English prompt like "initialize MkDocs with a good structure for technical docs" and gets things rolling within minutes, right there in the browser.</p>

            <p>Next, I have it help me with the setup for deployment to #GitHub Pages. The agent handles the configuration steps and automates that first deploy, so my docs go live almost instantly without any annoying manual steps or worrying about the secrets and build settings.</p>

            <p>As the project evolves, I'll eventually migrate the site to an #Azure Static Web App. Copilot's Coding Agent steps in again to automate the migration process, set up workflows, tweak build scripts, and even refine environment variables for deployment. I have total confidence that everything is secure since the agent operates inside GitHub Actions, which keeps my credentials, environments, and code protected.</p>

            <p>For testing, I always rely on #Playwright. Instead of writing the config or tests from scratch, I just tell Copilot Agent something like "add Playwright for browser-based testing and set up some sample tests for page navigation and search." It installs the dependencies, sets up the test structure, and gives me example scripts to build on. All of this happens inside Codespaces or GitHub.com, so I never have to switch tools or leave the cloud.</p>

            <h2>My Workflow</h2>
            <p>To sum up, my workflow looks like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>📘 Start a new repo on GitHub.com and use Copilot's Agent to set up MkDocs</li>
                <li>🚀 Deploy the docs using GitHub Pages with automated configuration and workflow setup</li>
                <li>🔄 Eventually migrate to Azure Static Web Apps when I need more power, letting the agent handle the details</li>
                <li>🧪 Integrate Playwright testing from the start for browser automation and end-to-end checks, set up quickly by Copilot's Agent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Every action is secure, traceable, and easy to review. I save so much time, and the agent never makes changes I cannot see and approve.</p>

            <h2>Learn More</h2>
            <p>For more technical details, GitHub's documentation covers exactly how the Coding Agent is built and kept secure: <a href="https://msft.it/6048tNm3n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Documentation</a></p>

            <h2>Your Turn</h2>
            <p>I have found this workflow makes starting and deploying new docs sites unbelievably fast and reliable. Is there anything you wish Copilot's Agent could automate next, or any part of this process you'd like to optimize further?</p>
