            <p>AI code assistants are getting good - sometimes uncannily so. Yesterday, I tossed a tricky function signature at GitHub Copilot and it came back not just with code, but also with inline comments and edge case handling.</p>

            <p>Was it perfect? No. But it got me 80% of the way, faster than ever before.</p>

            <h2>Speed Meets Smart Solutions</h2>
            <p>The greatest value I've seen isn't just in speed. It's also about how AI can surface solutions or patterns I wouldn't have thought of - sometimes even reminding me of security or efficiency considerations I might skip when under deadline pressure.</p>

            <h2>The Critical Review Process</h2>
            <p>But here's the kicker: trusting AI with your code means reviewing, understanding, and sometimes correcting its output. I've caught a few "almost-there" moments that needed a guiding hand.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices When Using AI Assistants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Always review generated code:</strong> Don't ship without reading through it</li>
                <li><strong>Understand the logic:</strong> Make sure you comprehend what the AI wrote</li>
                <li><strong>Test thoroughly:</strong> Verify edge cases and error scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Check security implications:</strong> Look for potential vulnerabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Correct when needed:</strong> Fix "almost-there" solutions that need adjustment</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Balancing Speed with Safety</h2>
            <p>The key is finding that sweet spot between leveraging AI's speed and maintaining your code quality standards. AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement for good engineering judgment.</p>

            <p>Are you using AI on real projects yet? What's your review process like when AI writes the draft code? Share your strategies (or war stories) for balancing speed with safety!</p>
