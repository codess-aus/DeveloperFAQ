Title: Don't Blindly Trust Your Code Assistant
Hero image: trustworthy.jpg

AI code assistants are getting good - sometimes uncannily so. Yesterday, I tossed a tricky function signature at GitHub hashtag#Copilot and it came back not just with code, but also with inline comments and edge case handling.

Was it perfect? No. But it got me 80% of the way, faster than ever before.

🏎️✨The greatest value I’ve seen isn’t just in speed. It’s also about how AI can surface solutions or patterns I wouldn’t have thought of - sometimes even reminding me of security or efficiency considerations I might skip when under deadline pressure.

But here’s the kicker: trusting AI with your code means reviewing, understanding, and sometimes correcting its output. I’ve caught a few “almost-there” moments that needed a guiding hand.

Are you using AI on real projects yet? What’s your review process like when AI writes the draft code? Share your strategies (or war stories) for balancing speed with safety!
